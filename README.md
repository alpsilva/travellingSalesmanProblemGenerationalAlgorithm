# travellingSalesmanProblemGenerationalAlgorithm
Generational Algorithm implementation to solve travelling salesman problems. When I say "solve", i mean, of course, getting a good enough solution that is close enough to the optimal one in a realistic amount of time!
  
For the datasets, I used:
http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html.  
Especifically the Djibouti one. If you want to use this solution, you can change the data inside points.txt to the one you want.
